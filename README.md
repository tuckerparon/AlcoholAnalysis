# Alcohol Analysis 🍷👨🏽‍💻

## What? 💻
'AlcoholAnalysis' is an analysis report on the connection between alcohol vs happiness, performance, and wellbeing. 
The analysis aims to explore how alcohol consumption impacts, is impacted by, or more so, relates to these three facets of life - each of which is 
defined by a set of selected variables from 3 data sets.

The analysis consists of basic linear regression and various simple visualisations (scatter plots, box plots, histograms, coefficient matrices, etc.). To execute these analysis tools, a combination of methods from Pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib were utilized.

The analysis is divied into two sections, the first just being happiness as this was an independent data set and the second being about performance and wellbeing and these overlapped in the remaining two datasets. This can be seen in the AlcoholAnalysis.ipynb file, which offers a full report including a motivation, data, methods, and conclusion section to provide background and further breakdown of the findings.

## Why? 🤔
This was a project inspired by a final project done in a STAT 287 (Data Science I) course at the University of Vermont taken in the Fall of 2021 under Professor James Bagrow. I have been focusing my time recently in completing more independent projects as this seems like the best way to learn - to start I figured I would partake in a more traditional exploratory analysis. The analyzed datasets were selected because alcohol is very prevalent in my age range and I was curious to see how it impacted people in a quantifiable way.

### More Notes 📝
The raw code files are included as well.
happiness_analysis.py includes the code for the analysis on the happiness dataset
performance_analysis.py includes the code for the analysis on the student performance and wellness dataset.
data is a folder including the two datasets (one was a merged set of two sub-datasets using code from the sub-datasets Kaggle).
